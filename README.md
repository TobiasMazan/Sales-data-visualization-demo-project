# Sales-data-visualization-demo-project

__1. Project overview__

In this demo exercise the goal was to visualize pastry sales data with Power BI and identify most profitable customers, products and sales time.

First matrix table aggregated incoming orders and grouped them by company name. Second matrix table agrregated units sold and total profits (as revenue minus cost) again grouping by company name. In both cases 'ACME Bites' has been identified as the most active customer.

First bar chart used custom aggregator measure to find total profit and revenue, group it by product name and calculate % profit margin for each product. It has been found 'Snickerdoodle' is the most profitable pastry product with margin over 60%. Second bar chart used iterator custom measure to divide days of the week into weekend and weekday categories and then calculate average daily profit in each of these. It has been found that weekend profits only marginally take over typical weekday sales.
